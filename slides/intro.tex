  \begin{card}[Aggregate Computing as a novel approach to \textit{collective computation}]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[\success{\faThumbsUp}] Aggregate Computing has been grown fastly in the last few years
      \item[\success{\faThumbsUp}] Pulverisation, design patterns, distributed schedulers are prosed to close the ``reality gap"
      \item[\failure{\faThumbsDown}] Some of the building blocks currently have some limitations
      \item[\failure{\faThumbsDown}] The algorithms configuration typically involve a fine-tuning of several parameters
      \item[\failure{\faThumbsDown}] Middleware aspects need apriori knowledge of the application domain
      \item[\highlightAlt{\faLightbulb}] Learning as a mechanism to improve adaptivity by  \emph{experience}
    \end{itemize}
